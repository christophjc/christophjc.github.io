<p><strong>If you want to catch some waves</strong><br>

Not far from the main town of Puerto Vallarta there is a little town called Sayulita. This place is better known for being a surfer’s paradise. Along the beach, there are several shacks where you can rent boards. And, if you are a newbie to surfing there are various that package a class lesson with a surf board rental.<br>

If you are on the beginner side it’s better to start at the Southern tip of the beach where waves are smaller and everyone is trying to learn so you are less likely to be competing with skilled surfers for the same waves. If you have experience under your belt or are serious surfer try going towards the reef where surfers line up to take turns on taking the waves. 
The best part is that in between sessions you can lay back on the beach and eat ceviche while drinking a beer and watching other people take on the waves.</p>
