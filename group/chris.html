        <h1>Three Days in Taipei</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="maintext">
        <p>Taiwan may not be number one on most lists of countries to visit in Asia - yet Taipei is one of Asia’s friendliest (and safest!) cities for Western tourists. The city has exceptionally high standards of living, and the experience is easier to swallow for tourists who want to explore Chinese culture than visiting the mainland or Hong Kong. Taiwanese people are very proud of their ultra-modern capital city, and with good reason: great food is surprisingly accessible and easy to find, residents are incredibly friendly and respectful in public and, best of all, the lack of tourists en masse provides for a unique urban experience.</p>

            <h2>Day 1 - Arrive in Taipei</h2>
            <p>Fly into Taiwan Taoyuan Int’l Airport (TPE) and take Taipei MRT to Taipei Central Station; Ubers and taxis from here to most districts are quite inexpensive.</p>
            <p>Caffeine refuel at Mr Brown Coffee: Don’t be fooled by the name: Mr Brown coffee is owned by the masterminds behind Kavalan Whiskey, voted the world’s best several years in a row, and roasts some of the best coffee in Taipei.</p>
            <p>Lunch in Da'an District: Restaurant options abound in this busy yet upscale commercial district.</p>
            <p>After a necessary afternoon siesta, head to the Shilin Night Market - considered the largest in the city - where you can choose from 500+ food vendors. Long lines won’t steer you wrong! Highlights: stinky tofu, blow-torched steak, Hot Star fried chicken</p>
            <p>Cocktails: For a taste of the young, creative scene in Taipei, check out RON Cafe + Bar. Tucked away on a quiet residential street just blocks from Shilin, the staff at RON make great cocktails and spin great tunes. Excellent people-watching.</p>

            <h2>Day 2 - Day Trip to Jiufen</h2>
            <p>Less than an hour away by train, Jiufen is a coastal mountain town - and taste of old Taiwan - that inspired Miyazaki’s 2001 film Spirited Away. Roam the town’s winding streets where you’ll find all sorts of street food options (stinky tofu aplenty).</p>
            <p>Must-haves: glutinous rice cakes, warm taro balls and peanut ice cream rolls. Afternoon tea is big here - try SIID CHA Tea House, and make sure to get a table on one of the upper floors for an incredible view rain-or-shine.</p>
            <p>Train back to Taipei Central Station</p>
            <p>Dinner at Jin Din Rou:</p>
            <p>Less popular (read: shorter wait time) than Din Tai Fung, Jin Din Rou serves excellent dim sum and entrees all day - including a wide range of options for vegetarians and pescetarians. Must-try: xiao long bao (soup dumplings), shrimp noodle soup, seafood dumplings.</p>
            <p>Bar-hopping in Ximen: Notorious for its flashing lights, arcade games and plethora of drinking holes, Ximen is a must-visit any night of the week. Called the Harajuku District of Taipei, it’s another excellent place to wander and people-watch at night. Try a carefully-crafted cocktail by the guys at Geography Bar (hidden on the third floor of an unassuming building), and finish the night off with a snack at Ay-Chung Flour Rice Noodle if the line isn’t too long. </p>

            <h2>Day 3 - Taipei 101 &amp; Fujintree</h2>
            <p>Coffee at Louisa Coffee: This trendy coffeeshop is very popular with locals. Delicious pastries, too!</p>
            <p>Head to Taipei 101 and have lunch at one of the many options in the food court (yes, food court!) or, if not too busy, head to this Din Tai Fung location. Try everything, but especially the soup dumplings!</p>
            <p>From here, it's a short walk to the Maokong Gondola. Board at the zoo and take the gondola all the way into the hills surrounding Taipei. The view is incredible, and there are plenty of treats available when you de-board.</p>
            <p>Head back to ground level and take the metro to Fujintree, dubbed the "Williamsburg" of Taipei. Plenty of shopping here, including a flagship location of Japanese retailers Beams.</p>
            <p>In the evening, head to Zhongshan for cocktails. Though typically thought of as a business zone, this former Japanese district houses some Japanese-style silent bars where sitting at the bar is required and very little conversing is allowed. The point? To relax and enjoy your drink.</p>
